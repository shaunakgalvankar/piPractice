# piPractice
this repo has all the files that i wrote for practice on the pi

The model of raspberry pi that i used was raspberry pi model 3b which comes with a built in 
wifi module and a bluetooth which is the most important thing as all the code testing was done 
by using the pi in the headless display mode..though it lags for commands that need to be entered fast enough
(in iot based projects)but is quiet good for learning and understanding on the fundamentals.
